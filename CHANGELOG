Version 1.9.2e-DEVEL (September 16, 2009)
--------------------------------
* We should explicitly enable net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct for kernel 2.6.27+
  to allow the use of traffic accounting and such (thank Lonnie)
* Don't /dev/null iptables -t nat related stuff. We just need the nat module, and that's all there is to it
! DROP any new traffic while firewall rules are generated so improper states are not created during start/restart
* The default OUTPUT policy no longer sees traffic after setting up the firewall rules in the chains
! Removed an unconditional ACCEPT in the EXT_OUTPUT_CHAIN keeping the POST_OUTPUT_CHAIN from seeing EXT_IF traffic
! Several fixes/changes for the POST_xxxx_CHAINs. This should make the POST stuff more
  consistent among INPUT/FORWARD/OUTPUT

Version 1.9.2d (August 24, 2009)
--------------------------------
* Renamed module_probe() to modprobe() and added deprecation warning
+ Updated traffic accounting plugin. Fixes another "rule-leak"
+ Updated sip-voip plugin (thanks Philip)
+ Updated traffic-shaper plugin (thanks Philip)

Version 1.9.2c (July 29, 2009)
------------------------------
! On reinit we must flush all chains in the nat & mangle tables else
  they will keep growing (Thanks Lonnie)
+ Updated IPSEC VPN plugin (Thanks Philip)
+ Updated Traffic Accounting plugin
+ Updated DynDNS Open plugin
+ Updated IDS plugin
! Fixed ICMP checks for IPv6
* Less defaulting to all ports/all hosts for several rules. This should mainly
  improve security in case of incorrect rules/configurations

Version 1.9.2b (June 25, 2009)
------------------------------
! Fixed DSL plugin causing errors on restart
* Detected iptables errors are now reported as WARNING rather than ERROR when the script finishes
+ Updated IPSEC-VPN plugin (Thanks Philip)
* Moved .aif_active_plugins to /var/tmp/
+ Detect plugins on stop() that have their priority number changed

Version 1.9.2a (June 9, 2009)
-----------------------------
* Dropped requirement of the ip binary in the main script

Version 1.9.2 (June 4, 2009)
----------------------------
* Bumped installer version to 1.0
! Fixed check_binary failed on dash-based systems (like Ubuntu) (Thanks Lonnie!)
! Fixed some bashisms
! Fixed DMZ_LAN_HOST_OPEN_IP didn't work

Version 1.9.1-RC1 (May 20, 2009)
--------------------------------
! Fixed DMZ_LAN_HOST_OPEN_xxx source hosts weren't parsed properly (Thanks to Lonnie Abelbeck)
! Fixed LOG_HOST_OUTPUT_xxx format error (Thanks to Lonnie Abelbeck)
+ Added local DNAT redirect support (Thanks to Philip Prindeville)
+ Added experimental DMZ-NAT plugin (Thanks to Philip Prindeville)
+ Implemented NAT_PREROUTING_CHAIN, POST_NAT_PREROUTING_CHAIN,
  NAT_POSTROUTING_CHAIN & POST_NAT_POSTROUTING_CHAIN chains
* Replaced DMZ_IF_TRUST and INT_IF_TRUST with the new IF_TRUSTS variable.
  You can use | to create seperate groups of interfaces.
+ We now detect whether iptables (/ip4tables/ip6tables) failed (somewhere)
  during startup and report this at the end
! Fixed NAT_FORWARD_IP not working
! Several fixes/changes in the rule parsers
* Moved from using the $IPTABLES/$IP4TABLES/$IP6TABLES variables to functions
  (Thanks Philip Prindeville). This should ie. allow proper tracing.
+ Iptables errors will now be shown in red, to better point them out
+ Implemented some additional chains (for ie. plugin use)
- Reverted flushing user chains before stopping plugins, it causes disconnections.
* Several cleanups/optimizations (thanks to Philip Prindeville, Lonnie Abelbeck
  & Roy Lanek)
* Major cleanup of functions etc.

Version 1.9.1-BETA1 (April 5, 2009)
-----------------------------------
* On a restart the "user_chains" are now flushed before the plugins are stopped
+ Implemented INPUT/FORWARD/OUTPUT_CHAIN. In this way we no longer have to clutter
  the builtin INPUT/FORWARD/OUTPUT chains.
* !!!! Changed the seperator for interface restrictions to # (ie. eth0#.....)!!!
  This code is now much cleaner and the way rules work is a lot more logical :)
! Fixed warnings with newer iptables versions
+ Plugin status & stop are now only called when the plugin is actually listed
  as being previously loaded (Thanks to Lonnie Abelbeck). ALL PLUGINS MUST BE
  UPDATED ACCORDINGLY!
* Rewrote the startup (and restart) code. This should make the restart command
  working a lot better (although it may also have broken some stuff)
+ Misc. tweaks
+ Added option to use extra arguments for functions that use dig
+ Updated several plugins
! EOL specification was invalid in the environment file

Version 1.9.0b (February 27, 2009)

! Fixed some security issues concerning firewall restart (thanks to Lonnie Abelbeck)
! Fixed invalid EOL causing blocked hosts to fail
! Fixed invalid sed-syntax causing blocked hosts to fail
- Removed MAC-filter from the main script (will be moved to seperate plugin)
! Fixed OUTPUT policy didn't get applied
! Fixed LOG_xxx_INPUT should be LOG_INPUT_xxx in the config file
* Small tweaks in the install script
+ Added wildcard_ifs() function to the environment-file
+ Updated several plugins
* Cleanup + fixed several typos (thanks Philip Prindeville)
* The restart command will now block all traffic from the external interfaces.
+ Host-block now has the option to keep established TCP connections, usefull for
  our restart command to NOT kill any running SSH connections
+ New (seperate) MAC filter plugin. Also allows to "lock" a MAC to an IP now

Version 1.9.0a (January 8, 2009)
--------------------------------
! Several fixes in the install script

-------------------------------
+ Some more fallback safeguards
! Fixed LAN_INET_HOST_DENY_TCP/UDP (stupid typo)
! Trimmed too long log messages
* Set timeout/retry values to default for dig functions in the env-file
! Fixed sysctl for ie. busybox setups which don't support -q. Implemented sysctl
  wrapper for this (like with module_probe())

- Removed old hfsc traffic shaper
+ Added net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max as additional sysctl key
+ Added AIF:-prefix to all LOG messages
+ Added ENV_FILE fallback in case it's not specified in the config-file
+ Enhanced the environment file to make it more robust in case config stuff is missing
- Removed <=2.2 kernel check

+ Updated Traffic Accounting plugin to 0.2BETA
* man pages are now gzipped by the installer
! Fixed incorrect configuration file used for the transparent proxy plugin

  (end of the chain) unless an OPEN_xxx is specified, in that case the default is DROP
! Fixed the use of source-destination-ip's with NAT forwards
+ Basic install script added (install.sh). Probably can use a lot of improvements.
* Moved a lot of functions/variables into a new separate "environment"-file.
  (located in /usr/share/arno-iptables-firewall/). This should make easier for
  ie. helper-scripts to use AIF's functions & variables
* Minor changes/updates in the plugins (slighty modified skeleton for example)
- Removed dsl ppp modem code and moved it into a separate plugin
* (Cosmetic) tweaks in the module_probe() function

Version 1.9.0-ALPHA2 (December 18, 2007)
----------------------------------------
! Fixed ICMPv6 types
* All (user) chains are now created in the beginning to allow plugins/custom
  rules to add rules to them.
+ Implemented separate variables for the iptables & ip6tables binaries. Instead
  of selecting the binary itself, IPv6 support can now be enabled/disabled via
  variable IPV6_SUPPORT
! Several fixes for IPv6 support
+ Implemented IPV6_SUPPORT variable for the "actual" IPV6 support
* Moved "old" IPV6_OVER_IPV4 to a plugin
* Host block now performed for ALL interfaces, not just the external one
* ICMP flooding changed from 20/sec max to 60/sec max.
+ Added suport for aliased external interface / multi-IP support. You can now
  also use the IP (instead of interface) of the interface to restrict INPUT/OUTPUT-
  rules

+ Major cleanup
* Cosmetic changes

Version 1.9.0-ALPHA1 (December 5, 2007)
---------------------------------------
+ Added DEFAULT_POLICY_DROP option to allow users to disable setting iptables
  default policy to DROP. Mainly useful for people who boot from ie. NFS
  (diskless client systems).
+ DNAT plugin update. Switched from OUTPUT to PREROUTING for the DNAT rule.
! Fixed a minor bug in the NAT forwards: the FORWARD rule was missing the host destination
+ Experimental IPv6 support. You can switch from IPv4 to IPv6 by simply changing
  the iptables into "ip6tables". Note that I'm currently not able to test it, as
  I don't have any IPv6 environment.
* NAT forwards no longer use : for host/port separation due to problems with
  future IPv6 support. Now the new separator (~) is also used for this.
+ Implemented DMZ_IF_TRUST trust, to setup DMZ-DMZ trusts
* Antispoof for DMZ & INTERNAL net now only enabled when INT_IF / DMZ_IF set
+ Implemented start/stop command for plugins. Now plugins can also contain code
  to be executed whenever the firewall stops. The start or stop command is
  put the environment variable called "PLUGIN_CMD" (which the plugin can read).
+ Major (and I mean, really MAJOR) code cleanup. This possibly broke a lot of stuff.
+ Implemented IP address ranges for ALL variables (use like 192.168.1.10-20)
+ Implemented support for restriction rules to apply only for certain external interfaces
* !!! Separator for combined host/port rules changed from : to ~ . This is mainly to
  be able create cleaner/easier parse functions & prevent any possible problems
  with the support for IPv6 (addresses), which also uses : !!!!
! Fixed INVALID rule for UDP
* Changed the name of a lot of inconsistent variables. Unfortunately this means
  that the new config won't be fully backwards compatible with firewall version 1.8
* Changed order of some of the variables in the config file so they are more
  synced to the logic flow/order of the firewall script
* Plugin support moved to the main script
* Plugin binaries moved to /usr/share/arno-iptables-firewall/plugins
+ (Finally) implemented nice init.d script with configurable verbosity
* Misc. cosmetic changes
