- Deprecated DNS_SERVERS & ROOT_DNS_SERVER. I wanted to
  get rid of this option for a long time. It shouldn't be neccesary anymore
  as it should be solved by changing some of the netfilter's timeout settings.
  Please contact me if the new settings cause problems (I think they still need
  some tweaking).

Version 1.8.3-RC3 (April 4, 2005)
---------------------------------
* Slightly modified the config file for better consistency
+ Added $BROADCAST_TCP_NOLOG & $BROADCAST_UDP_NOLOG to drop certain broadcast
  packets

  server (You can now also use it to separate your wireless LAN from your wired 
  LAN).

  improved performance
! Fixed TOS Mangling / MSS set. Moved these rules to the beginning of the 
  script to let MSS set also apply for eg. NAT traffic.
* Enabled RP_FILTER again by default

Version 1.8.3-RC2 (March 22, 2005)
----------------------------------

  multiple external interfaces
+ Added variables $LOG_HOST_INPUT & $LOG_HOST_OUTPUT to log incoming or 
  outgoing packets to or from certain hosts

  required now)

Version 1.8.3-RC1 (February 9, 2005)
------------------------------------
+ Inline comments are now allowed in the MAC address / blocked hosts files
* Removed IANA reserved net list from rc.iptables. It simply changes too often 
  and I refuse to check/update the list every week. Instead you can add the 
  addresses from IANA reserved nets to your BLOCK HOSTS file, if you really 
  think this would make the world safer, but I doubt it.
+ Stricter FORWARD policy for the internal net + better logging of dropped 
  FORWARD packets from the internal net.
! Fixed bug for SNAT in combination with Freeswan
* Changed the order of some rules for consistency

Version 1.8.3-BETA5 (January 22, 2005)
--------------------------------------
*! All the fixes that really should have been in BETA4 ;-)
! Fixed a bug in the MAC address filtering (now it should really work)

Version 1.8.3-BETA4 (January 8, 2005)
-------------------------------------
! Fixed a random bug causing blocked hosts file / mac address file to be read 
  even when disabled (#)
* Changed external DHCP client support. This should fix problems with eg. Demon.nl
! Fixed a bug in the the anti-spoof protection for the internal subnet
* IANA reserved net dropping is now disabled by default as this list simply changes too often

Version 1.8.3-BETA3 (June 19, 2004)
-----------------------------------
+ Added support for MAC address filtering for internal hosts
* Added base-directory inside the tgz-package
! Fixed logging of invalid ICMP packets
* Changed back the way what are considered to be "privileged" ports. Now they 
  are <1024 again.
+ Added new variable MASQ_MULTI_ROUTE to enable/disable NAT (masquerading) 
  routing via multiple external interfaces. Note that you should properly 
  configure your route table to make this properly work. This option is 
  therefor disabled by default.
* Minor cleanups

Version 1.8.3-BETA2 (May 19, 2004)
----------------------------------
! Fixed texts/rules for ICMP (flood) logging
* Replaced ICMP_DROP_LOG-variable with ICMP_REQUEST_LOG-variable. Also added 
  a new variable ICMP_OTHER_LOG to log misc. other ICMP packets
! Fixed NAT internet interface parsing for multiple external interfaces
* Rule order changed for better consistency
! Fixed related state concerning ICMP packets for EXT_IF
! Fixed (A)DSL modem management
- Traffic shaper has been removed from the package (no longer supported)

Version 1.8.3-BETA1 (May 12, 2004)
----------------------------------
* The default policy that internal subnets trust each other has been altered. 
  Now (internal) interface-2-interface is NOT allowed (accepted) by default. 
  You can change this behaviour by putting the interfaces that trust each other
  in $INT_IF_TRUST.
+ Added support for DMZ-to-LAN (port-) forwards. This allows you to let a 
  server in the DMZ to use specific services running on internal hosts (eg. 
  SMTP). I implemented the new DMZ_LAN_xxx_FORWARD variables for this purpose.
+ Added support for IPv6. No filtering support though, only an option to 
  enable protocol 41 for IPv6.
+ Added support for multiple external interfaces. Note that the FIRST one is 
  used for NAT traffic!
* By default DROP_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES is now disabled (0) in the configuration 
  file. This is to fix the problems a lot of (unexperienced) people have when 
  using my firewall on a machine inside a LAN. The security impact of this 
  measure (in my opinion) is minor.
+ Better handling/consistency for nat / mangle tables
+ Added autodetection of the awk-binary type to fwfilter. Now you no longer 
  have to explicitly set it in fwfilter manually :-).
+ Added new variable LAN_OUTPUT_DENY_LOG to enable/disable logging of dropped 
  outgoing LAN connections.
- DENY_LOG has been deprecated. It has been superseded by the "NOLOG" variables
+ Added HOST_REJECT_xxx_NOLOG variables. Because of this the REJECT_LOG 
  variable has been deprecated.
* Updated the IANA reserved net list -> The 83/8 and 84/8-nets were removed as 
  they now belong to RIPE.
+ Added support for SMTP, FTP & POP3 transparent proxies (Thanks to Daniel 
  Bartz for the patch). For this new variables $HTTP_PROXY_PORT,
  $SMTP_PROXY_PORT, $FTP_PROXY_PORT & $POP3_PROXY_PORT are introduced. The old
  $PROXY_PORT variable has been obsoleted.
* Code / config-file cleanups
* Cosmetic changes
