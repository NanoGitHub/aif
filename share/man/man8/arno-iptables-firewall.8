.SH "NAME"
\fBarno\-iptables\-firewall\fR \- Single\- & multi\-homed firewall script with DSL/ADSL support.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B /etc/init.d/arno\-iptables\-firewall 
[start|stop|status|force\-reload|restart]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBarno\-iptables\-firewall\fP is an iptables configuration script. 
While it is extremely easy to use one can nevertheless use it in quite 
complicated environments.
.P
All available options are explained in the extensively documented 
configuration file.
.P
The external interface of the system needs to be set up properly in the 
firewalls configuration file (EXT_IF). 
The default behavior of the firewall is to deny all incoming connection
attempts.
.P
For additional requirements not covered by the configuration file 
custom iptables rules can be placed in 
/etc/arno\-iptables\-firewall/custom\-rules. 
This file is automatically parsed by the service script. 
.P
See the documentation in 
.I  /usr/share/doc/arno\-iptables\-firewall 
for an example how to manage logging of firewall events through 
.B  syslogd.
.P
The \fBarno\-fwfilter\fR script can be used to make the firewall logs more readable for humans (see manpage).
.P
There is currently only very limited support for IPv6. More precisely one can only allow or deny IPv6 traffic completely, but filtering is not possible (yet).
.P
Several plugins for the firewall script are available online. All plugins can
be downloaded from
.I http://rocky.eld.leidenuniv.nl/iptables-firewall/plugins
and have to be stored in /etc/arno-iptables-firewall/plugins. Please see the documentation
in /usr/share/doc/arno-iptables-firewall to learn about how to enable them.
